# maze_generator
generates mazes

this maze generator takes inspiration from Samuele Girgenti, whose work made me understand how maze generators work. (i was too lazy to find tutorial so i just went over how his code worked, great code btw)

This code DOES NOT solve mazes, it just makes a maze. there is no exit or entrance to this maze, because it is meant to be a map generator for another project.

No valgrind errors. if you want to copy it word for word, be my guest, just know that it's not strictly a maze generator anymore, cus there is no defined exit or entry.
